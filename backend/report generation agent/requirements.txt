# Report Generation Agent Requirements
# 
# This module now uses the unified requirements from the agentic module.
# Install with: pip install -r ../agentic/requirements.txt
#
# All dependencies (including LLM providers, LangChain, Pathway, and document processing)
# are now managed centrally in backend/agentic/requirements.txt
#
# This ensures consistent versions across both agentic and report generation modules.

# To install:
# cd backend/agentic
# pip install -r requirements.txt

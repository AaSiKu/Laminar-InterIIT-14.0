    "3. MAX_REPLANS_REACHED: Replan limit exceeded - synthesize best answer from available results\n"

    "GUIDELINES:\n"

    "2. Use the planner's reasoning to understand the strategy behind the actions\n"
    "3. Use data from multiple action outputs when needed\n"

    "  * Specific guidance on avoiding previous errors\n"
    "  * What alternative approaches should be tried\n"

    "- If action results provide sufficient information → AggregatorFinish with synthesized answer\n"
    "- If errors occurred but results are adequate → AggregatorFinish acknowledging limitations\n"
